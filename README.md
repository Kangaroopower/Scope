##About
This is a Find and Replace Script for wikia. It comes with match highlighting, case (in)sensitive 
replaces, replace all/one features and a sleek UI.

##Warning
This is the alpha channel.
The program may be buggy and is in very active development so what you see today may be completely different tommorow. 
To use the beta and stable versions of the script, visit [the official code page](http://kangaroopower.wikia.com/wiki/Scope).

##Notes
3.0 is coming with a completely new coding style- event oriented coding, a completely new GUI, a reworked and unbuggy shadow function, a much improved load process, as well as an API.
