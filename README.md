##About
This is a Find and Replace Script for wikia. It comes with match highlighting, case (in)sensitive 
replaces, replace all/one features and a sleek UI.

##Warning
Because Scope is approaching it's 3.0 release, this has turned into the alpha channel for the code. 
It currently has no GUI as that is in a complete redesign and the program may be buggy. To use 
the beta and stable versions of the script, visit [the official code page](http://kangaroopower.wikia.com/wiki/Scope).

##Notes
3.0 is coming with a completely new coding style- event oriented coding, a completely new GUI, a reworked and unbuggy shadow function, a much improved load process, as well as an API.
